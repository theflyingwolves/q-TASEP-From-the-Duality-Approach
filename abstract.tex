In this thesis, I studied the model q-TASEP from the duality approach with main reference to the two papers \cite{duality2014} and \cite{asymptotics2013}. An ansatz explicit formula for the expectation of q-Laplace transform of the probability function describing the position of a particular particle at any time in the future in form of the nested contour integral will be provided. After this, I worked to transform a generating function of the nested contour integrals to the form of a Fredholm determinant using both the Mellin-Barnes type approach and the Cauchy-type approach. The thesis is then concluded with an asymptotic analysis on the behaviour of the rescaled fluctuation of a particular particle around its macroscopic position.
