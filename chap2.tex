\chapter{Duality and Nested Contour Integral Ansatz Solution}
In this chapter, we recall the definition of duality between two Markov process defined in \cite{interacting-particle-system}. Then we prove the duality between q-TASEP and q-TAZRP. We then conclude by giving an ansatz solution for q-TASEP with step initial data as well as half stationary initial data.
